# Keeper App
## What it does
This is a small clone of the Google Keep note-taking app, with only the features to write and create a note, with title, content and date of creation displayed in each note component.
## How does it look?

## Acknowledgement
This project is heavily-inspired from one of Dr Angela's course on Udemy about Full Stack Web Development. The styling and date functionality is addition over to her project.
